Steps to reproduce:

 * `0-setup.sh` : Install all required R and Python packages. Needs python 3 and R

 * `1-launch_exps.sh`: Launch experiments (this takes significant time). You may need to edit the contents of the file to match your computer setup.

 * `2-collect_results.py`: Run once after all the experiments have completed.

 * `3-analysis.ipynb`: Main analysis

 * `4-visualize_sol.ipynb`: Visualization of solutions.

 * `5-statistics.R`: Statistical tests.
